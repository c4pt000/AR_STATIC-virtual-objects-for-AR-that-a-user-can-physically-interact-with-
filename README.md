# AR_STATIC-virtual-objects-for-AR-that-a-user-can-physically-interact-with-vvirtual objects for AR that a user can physically interact with:

(drafting **WIP)

my own personal design thinking of AR based physical objects that are harmless to the touch even an AI based human avatar only visible through AR contact lens or an AR viewer
but the user can feel the human avatar or 3d object as nothing but electro-static at minimal levels that are not dangerous or harmful,

similar to the way 3d audio works to project audio into different areas of a small room

by placing a type of audio system in all four corners like surround 10.2 speakers but not for audio but for low low level electron-discharge to create concentrated levels of low low level static electricity into directed areas of a room with physical shape of either a human being or a 3d physical object either as small as a bar of soap or as large as a full size desk

the user can view the AR visual object with AR contact lenses or an AR viewer and a cellular phone app in the users pocket to track the users location in a room where the small boxes in the corners of the room can intensify low low level electron static output in small circular beams anywhere from 3inches in diameter up to 5 to 6 ft in diameter and shape

the user having just their phone in their pocket trackcing their movement round a room can direct the unseen harmless static electricity that the systems computer unit can physical form using a type of 3d cad template (even a lininig on the ceiling as a ceiling panel for a low cost install with a grid tile of output from a low level ceiling of less than 10 ft from the floor to help guide the boxes in the corners of the room (similar to a stereo install but not for audio)


to interact with an AI based AR avatar whether for informational purposes or for entertainment purposes,


also the possibility of lightweight clothing of regular style with sensors on the inside of the clothing to feel low low level static for the user to have tactile response to what they are interacting with 


all less than probably 3V volt of static electicity

Noticing similar technology involving air jets and visual holograms
